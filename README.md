🌳 Binary Tree Pruning Adventure! 🌟
Welcome to the exciting world of binary tree pruning! 🎉 This README will guide you through the problem, the two awesome solutions, and a fun comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. Buckle up for a tree-trimming journey! 🚀
🎯 What’s the Problem? 🤔
Imagine a binary tree where each node is either a 0 or a 1. Your mission? 🕵️‍♂️ Chop off any subtree that’s only filled with 0s and has no 1s. A subtree is a node and all its descendants. The goal is to return the root of the freshly pruned tree! 🌿
Example Time! 📊
Input Tree:
      1
     / \
    0   1
   / \
  0   0

Output Tree:
      1
       \
        1

Why? The left subtree rooted at 0 is all 0s, so it gets the axe! 🪓
🛠️ The Solutions: Two Ways to Prune! ✨
We’ve got two fantastic approaches to tackle this tree-trimming challenge. Let’s dive into them! 🏊‍♂️
🌟 Solution 1: The Detective Approach 🕵️‍♀️
This method uses a helper function to investigate if a subtree has any 1s. If not, it’s pruning time! �剪刀 It processes the tree in a post-order fashion (left, right, root) and decides what to keep or cut.

How It Works: 
A detective function checks for 1s in a subtree. 🕵️
The main function prunes left and right subtrees, then uses the detective’s report to decide if a subtree should be removed. 🚫
If a node is 0 and has no kids, it’s outta here! 💨



🚀 Solution 2: The One-Pass Wonder ⚡
This approach is sleek and speedy! 🏎️ It prunes the tree in a single sweep, checking and trimming as it goes, without needing a separate detective.

How It Works:
Zooms through the tree in post-order (left, right, root). 🏃‍♂️
Prunes left and right subtrees, then checks if the current node is 0 with no children. If so, it’s gone! 🗑️
Returns the trimmed node or keeps it if it’s valid. ✅



🥳 Pros and Cons: Let’s Compare! ⚖️
Both solutions are awesome, but they’ve got their own vibes. Here’s the showdown! 🥊
🌈 Solution 1: Detective Approach
Pros 😎:

Super Clear! 📖 The detective function makes it easy to see what’s happening.
Flexible! 🛠️ Easy to tweak if you need to change what you’re pruning (like hunting for 2s instead of 1s).
Modular! 🧩 Separates the logic for checking and pruning, like a well-organized toolbox.

Cons 😿:

Slower! 🐢 The detective checks subtrees multiple times, which can take a while for big trees.
More Work! 📝 Extra code means more to read and maintain.
Redundant! 🔄 Revisits nodes, which isn’t super efficient.

🌟 Solution 2: One-Pass Wonder
Pros 🎉:

Lightning Fast! ⚡ Zips through the tree once, making it super efficient.
Short and Sweet! 📄 Less code means it’s easy to read and maintain.
No Wasted Moves! 🏃‍♂️ Every node is visited just once, keeping things snappy.

Cons 😕:

Less Obvious! 🤔 The logic is packed into one function, which might be trickier to grasp at first.
Less Flexible! 🔧 Changing the pruning rules means digging into the main function.

🏆 Which One to Pick? 🤩

Go for Solution 2 if you want speed and simplicity! 🚀 It’s perfect for big trees or when performance is key. 💪
Choose Solution 1 if you need clarity or plan to tweak the pruning rules often. 🕵️‍♀️ It’s great for teaching or flexible projects! 📚

🌟 Fun Facts & Tips 🎉

Both solutions handle edge cases like empty trees or trees with no 1s. 🥳
The TreeNode*& reference in the code isn’t strictly needed—regular pointers work just fine! 😎
For super unbalanced trees, Solution 1 might feel like a marathon, so Solution 2 is your sprinter! 🏃‍♂️
